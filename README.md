**NAME**

Develop a trust fund for your kids through means of a time locked wallet for digital asssets.  

**Background:**
With a 3 year old and a little bub on the way (due date 31 Jan 2022) I have explored many of the different options that allow you to store/invest funds for your kids and I recognised the need for a decentralized means of storing digital assets as investments for our children. 

Cryptocurrency has proven that it's here to stay and that, in many cases, it is a profitable means of storing cash or funds. In the current time we find ourselves in many of the centralized currencies and banks have proven to not be as trustworthy as we once believed them to be. This should not take away from the fact that our kids need to be looked after and that we need a means of storing funds for them from a young age that could help them pay for tertiary education, their first car or first house. 

**How will my DApp work?**
Through means of a time lock contract you are able to deposit tokens into a wallet that will be locked until your child reaches of age. Only once the specified birthday is reached the funds will be released and transferred to them.
