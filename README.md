My final project idea

Develop a vault that can be added to your MetaMask wallet to store important/personal info in one place.
Your private key will be able to "unlock" the vault and access all of your linked personal/medical/investment information and documents in one place. 

The idea would be to have a secure, online place to store all of your important information that only you are able to access. When needing to share any of the information one can do so with the use of your public key - the shared information will present itself as a snapshot at that specific time allowing the third party to view only the shared documents/portfolio.
