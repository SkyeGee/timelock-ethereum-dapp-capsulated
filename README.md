**My final project idea**

Develop a vault that can be linked to your MetaMask wallet to store important & personal info in one place.
Your private key will be able to "unlock" the vault and access all of your linked personal/medical/investment information and documents in one place. 

The blunt idea would be to have a secure, online place to store all of your important information that only you are able to access. When needing to share any of the information one can do so with the use of a public key - the shared information will present itself as a 'snapshot' at that specific time allowing the third party to access only the time specific view of the document/portfolio. 

Background:
I find it immensely frustrating to have to access different locations for different personal information. Hopefully this will aid the "admin" part of our personal lives by providing access to all of our info in one location and furthermore allowing us to share specific documents or info safely via the same platform. (I am thinking of the need to access or share investment portfolios, ID verifications, financial statements, wills, birth certificates, medical info etc)

Thoughts:
1) Since security is severely important would it be better to limit the application to desktop access only?
2) Storage of data - make use of IPFS, Arweave more cost effective than ethereum?
3) Use cases for smart contract: how could a smart contract be used to confirm the legitimacy of the third party requesting to view required data?

* Secure the contents and the proper triggering of data transfers.
